##The Ultimate Information Society##

We know this from watching movies:
We start looking up information about the film, 
the actors, products within the film etc. on the web with our 
smartphones or tablets while watching. But how about a second screen for photos? 
Whenever I discover a photo that was made at an unusual place or scenes from everyday
life I’d like to get more information about the motif or the objects on that photo – 
and then I look it up on the internet.

I thought of an app that looks up information automatically. 
Take a photo, then tag or let other people tag what’s on there. 
For example: a photo shows a can of Coke, you or someone else correctly 
tags it as “Coke“ and the app automatically loads information related to “Coke”. 
The Wikipedia article, news sources, company profile...
you should also be able to see where the persons, who tagged the photo with the same tags,
are right at that moment you are looking at the photo in order to connect to each other.

Perhaps you want to have a drink together and talk about photographing? 
The vision behind this hack is to connect the knowledge accessible 
in the World Wide Web with the visual information provided in shared photos.

This project which has been initiated during a late summers' Hackday in Berlin organized by EyeEm tries to set the
foundation for a semantic tagging facility that lets you add context for any photo that you're going to find
on your favorite platforms. Currently we're only supporting the EyeEm API for getting photos but extending the
functionality is just a matter of implementing API endpoints. 

We're creating pixel-precise additional tags on photos so you can tag everyday ("social") objects as you discover
them on an image. An overlay shows options to retrieve additional information about the tagged object, currently
only a map view is supported, though. Using semantic databases like Freebase should make it possible to add
additional value to your photos.
